# Internet of Things

#### World before Internet of Things - Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Communication

M2M refers to direct communication between devices or machines, enabling them to exchange data and perform tasks without human intervention.

- Production and Manufacturing Machines
- Electrical Telegraph
- Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP) - (shares some basic principles with M2M technology)
#### Introduction to Internet of Things
IoT is simply making the devices/physical things connect to the Internet and let them exchange information.

Where thing can be any device that can give information or act upon given signal or information.
#### Goal of an IoT system

> Gather -> Send -> Receive -> Act
#### Lifecycle of an IoT system

> Sense -> Connect -> Collect -> Infer -> Act

#### Anatomy of an IoT Device
